How API calls are made through the termux-api helper binary
===========================================================
The [termux-api](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/termux-api/termux-api.c) client binary in the `termux-api` package generates two linux anonymous namespace sockets, and passes their address to the [TermuxApiReceiver broadcast receiver](https://github.com/termux/termux-api/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/termux/api/TermuxApiReceiver.java) as in:
	
	/system/bin/am broadcast ${BROADCAST_RECEIVER} --es socket_input ${INPUT_SOCKET} --es socket_output ${OUTPUT_SOCKET}

The two sockets are used to forward stdin from `termux-api` to the relevant API class and output from the API class to the stdout of `termux-api`.

Client scripts
==============
Client scripts which processes command line arguments before calling the `termux-api` helper binary are available in [the termux-api package](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master/packages/termux-api).

Ideas
=====
- Method for playing audio files using the system MediaPlayer, so `termux-play myfile.ogg` would play the audio file.
- Wifi network search and connect.
- Proximity sensor.
- Accelerometer.
- LED Flash.
